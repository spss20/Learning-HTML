    <h1>Ludo</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ludo from Latin ludo '[I] play') is a strategy board game for two to
      four[a] players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to
      finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle
      games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi.[1] The game and its
      variations are popular in many countries and under various names.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Mahabharta</h3>
    <p>
      Pachisi was created in India in the sixth century CE. The earliest
      evidence of this game's evolution in India is the depiction of boards on
      the caves of Ellora. The original version is also described in the Indian
      epic Mahabharata in which Shakuni uses cursed dice to beat the Pandavas,
      and at last after losing everything, Yudhisthira puts his wife Draupadi on
      stake and loses her, too. The Pandavas get all their belongings back,
      though, after Draupadi vows to curse the whole Kuru lineage, but stops at
      the intervention of Gandhari, and seeing an opportunity to still
      Draupadi's anger, Kuru king Dhritarashtra promises to give back to the
      Pandavas all that they had lost in the game. It was also known as Chaupar
      in ancient times. The contemporary version was played by the Mughal
      emperors of India; a notable example is Akbar.[2] Pachisi was modified to
      use a cubic die with a die cup and patented as "Ludo" in England in
      1896.[b][3][4] The Royal Navy took Ludo and converted it into the board
      game Uckers.[5]
